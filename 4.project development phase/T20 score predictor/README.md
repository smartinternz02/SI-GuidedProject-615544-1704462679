# T20 World Cup Score Predictor

---

## Project Description and Workflow

The objective of the T20 World Cup Score Prediction project is to forecast the cumulative runs a cricket team is expected to score in a T20 match, utilizing the XGBoost algorithm. XGBoost, a widely employed machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis, is employed for this purpose.

#### The workflow for the T20 World Cup Score Prediction project is as follows:

- ```Data Collection:``` Gather information on historical T20 cricket matches, encompassing details such as the participating teams, runs scored, wickets taken, overs bowled, and other pertinent data. Source this information from diverse cricket databases, APIs, or reputable websites dedicated to cricket statistics.

- ```Data Preprocessing:``` Perform data cleaning and preprocessing procedures to guarantee consistency and accuracy. Tasks may include addressing missing values, managing categorical variables, and conducting feature engineering to enhance the quality of the dataset.

- ```Feature Selection:``` Determine the most pertinent features for the prediction model by employing techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance ranking, and leveraging domain knowledge.

- ```Model Training:``` Utilize the preprocessed data and the identified features to train an XGBoost model. XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm that employs decision trees as base learners for the training process.

- ```Model Evaluation:``` Assess the performance of the XGBoost model by employing metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model.

- ```Prediction:``` Apply the trained and optimized XGBoost model to make predictions for the total runs scored by a team in a T20 cricket match, utilizing the relevant features identified during the model training process.

- ```Deployment:``` Implement the deployment of the XGBoost model as a web application on Streamlit Cloud.
